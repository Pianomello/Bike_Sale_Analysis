# Interactive Excel Dashboard for Bike Purchase Trends Analysis



## Overview

I created an interactive Bike Sales Dashboard in Excel by cleaning and preparing the data first—de-duping, substituting codes such as "M" with "Married", and aggregating ages with nested IF formulas. I formatted income into currency and segmented users into age groups. I investigated insights such as how income, age, and commute distance affect bike buying with Pivot Tables. The last dashboard has dynamic marital status, region, and other filters (Slicers) so it is simple to investigate trends at a glance.


## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Started by creating a working copy of the original dataset and
cleaning the entries — removed duplicates, replaced ambiguous
codes (e.g., “M” → “Married”, “F” → “Female”) using Excel’s Find &
Replace feature for better readability and clarity.

- **Data Formatting:** Transformed income values into currency format for easy
interpretation. Converted raw age data into categorized age brackets
using nested IF statements, breaking down users into Adolescent,
Middle Age, and Old Age groups.

- **Pivot Table Insights:**

1. Income vs Bike Purchase – Analyzed how income levels vary
depending on whether someone purchased a bike.

2. Commute Distance vs Purchase – Interpreted how travel
distance affects the likelihood of buying a bike. For clarity,
labels like “10+ Miles” were renamed to “More than 10 Miles”.

3. Age Group vs Purchase – Assessed the influence of age
brackets on buying behavior.

- **Dashboard Creation:** Designed an interactive dashboard using Pivot Tables and Slicers to
filter results by Marital Status, Region, Occupation, and Education
Level. The dashboard allows users to instantly view dynamic changes
in charts and summaries based on selected filters.
