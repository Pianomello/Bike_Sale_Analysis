# Interactive Excel Dashboard for Bike Purchase Trends Analysis

## Overview

I created an interactive Bike Sales Dashboard in Excel by cleaning and preparing the data firstâ€”de-duping, substituting codes such as "M" with "Married", and aggregating ages with nested IF formulas. I formatted income into currency and segmented users into age groups. I investigated insights such as how income, age, and commute distance affect bike buying with Pivot Tables. The last dashboard has dynamic marital status, region, and other filters (Slicers) so it is simple to investigate trends at a glance.
